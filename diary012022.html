<div class="entry"><p><strong>january 10th, 2022</strong><br>Codex on TikTok brings up a good point, where intelligence is measured solely by cruel actions by humankind. See here:<br><br>Dolphins are very intelligent animals, communicating to each other with sounds like humans do. Despite this intelligence, they are not committed to the evil that humans are, purely using their intelligence for survival rather than societal needs. So we call them less intelligent than humans.<br><br>In the Christian Bible, the Garden of Eve represents the original sin–that knowledge and intelligence in of themselves is evil. This metaphor has spread so wide and so thin that we as a community can only detect intelligence through sin itself. However, in other Abrahamic religions, this original sin is not believed in and truly the inherent guilt of being born is solely a Christian idea.<br><br>Despite science’s wants to dissect itself from religion, its measurements are still inherently Christian and will likely never change. I’ve been thinking of buying The Great Partnership by Johnathan Sacks, though I always have worry for the bias and propaganda embedded in those kinds of books. It has a good ranking on Goodreads. I don’t know.</p></div>
<div class="entry"><p><strong>january 8th, 2022</strong><br>It’s Saturday! I’m very happy about the weekend. Truly it will fly by fast, however, I am glad to have a little touch of a break before school really gets rolling.<br><br>I’ve decided I want to take a language model and feed it entirely Jung and Freud essays, and see what comes out. Isabel Myers’ Gifts Differing is an interpretation of predominantly Jung but secondarily Freud’s psychological theory, so, this kind of generated psychoanalysis has already been created by hand. However, I think it would be cool if a robot could write a new academic paper on its own. And, you know, maybe it’ll do my college homework for me.<br><br>My foot is mostly healed, if you care. It’s still frustrating to walk on however I wouldn’t document it as painful. Today my household is dogsitting–there are two dogs more to my house than usual, and it’s nice to have active dogs again. My dog has had brain cancer for the past few years, so he’s not really there, and I do miss when he was active and jumpy and all-around a happy dog. I’m assured he’s still happy, honestly, my dad takes care of him so I have no real idea, but he still walks with a pep in his step and the same dumbassery he has always had.<br><br>When I tell people about the condition of my dog, I start laughing. I don’t know why, and it’s embarrassing and cruel, but I feel my brain has lost a link with grief that it used to have, and now I cannot process it properly anymore. I don’t know! It’s a tad uncomfortable.<br><br>My life has been pretty boring these last two days. I managed to sleep for hours yesterday, from noon to 6 pm, despite the fact I didn’t feel tired at all. These days, I let my body do what it wants, honestly. And sometimes it holds a few surprises! (Never good ones.)<br><br>The first tech night for my next production is this Friday. I plan on attending. It should be fun! And I really hope a lot of components can be included this time, where the last show we did was down to its bare essentials and not very pretty. While I cannot carry all the weight, I will try my hardest and hope that my friends do the same. I’m sure they will–I’m close with the stage manager, and she’s working very hard despite most of her work supposedly being handled by the director. I’ve heard a lot of negative things about the director, but a job is a job, and we must listen to the boss.</p></div>
<div class="entry"><p><strong>january 6th, 2022</strong><br>Two days ago, I slipped on the ice and fell, practically breaking my foot. Now, it is walkable, but still a pain in my ass. Funnily enough, the way I walk on an injured foot is very flat compared to my normal stride–so my knee is hurting too. I’m not having the greatest time.<br><br>In American Literature I am being forced against my will to read Edgar Allen Poe, but watching my literature teacher scramble to explain psychological theories is very funny. No one talks about how Freud wanted to fuck his mom–most big psychoanalysis professors aren’t really that right in the head. Anyway,<br><br>Ego death is something I’m very familiar with. In the first days of 2020, my previous ego had up and killed itself right in front of my eyes. The grieving process was close to that of a loved one, but, under the stress, I had rebuilt myself from genuine nothingness. This also coincided with the beginning of my femininity, where I would soon become extremely femme in contrast to my masculine presentation mere months before. But I wish he could see me now: mildly slutty, very much in pain, but with an ego that could combat god himself.<br><br>Friends have told me that it’s a histrionic personality disorder, to have self-awareness like this. I’ve never thought of it that way. Many people have given me an array of armchair diagnoses–schizoid, borderline, histrionic, autism, bipolar–but it doesn’t really matter, does it? And at the offense of the medical community and those who prioritize doctors’ notes over anything else on the internet; regardless of whatever goes on my medical record I won’t suddenly change, my problems won’t suddenly become legitimate, it only provides legality. <br><br>(Just yesterday I pushed my ACT accommodations request. That is an example of legality, and it requires a diagnosis. However, my personality does not.)<br><br>I’m hoping for it to snow again tonight. Not having school tomorrow would be great for my foot, giving it time to recover.</p></div>
<div class="entry"><p><Strong>january 5th, 2022</Strong><br>I am excited to say that I have launched my first website. While I've had a passion for HTML since 2018, I had never felt that it was complete until i published this page. Obviously, this website is still very vacant, but the publishication in of itself is something I am proud of.<br><br>I showed my github hosting to my mother, and she was impressed. So, I have decided to continue this project. In the october tab there is previous thing I have written as a way to sample this diary, you may read if you'd like.<br><br>Thank you for your visit here, really. I appreaciate it more than explainable, person on the internet.</p></div>
