                 i am on tumblr dot com searching up "html" for ideas. a lot of the stuff is super cute these days. should i go back to making templates and themes and stuff? i feel like this site is pretty much set for life now. i accidentally made it so unbelivably easy to do things like add journal entires that i find it boring.<br><br>i guess i have more important things to deal with, now. but i miss being a kid.</p>

                i'm so sick. i keep thinking about why i do this diary thing. i don't really have anything interesting to say, and most of my thoughts go on twitter or tumblr depending on their nature. i actually run a daily thing on twitter already, i guess, i just love talking about myself. talking about things that happened in the past instead of when they're currently going on. a summmary. a reflection? a standing in the middle of the road while a semi is coming at you but when you think you're about to get hit you pass through like a ghost. you're a ghost :)</p>

                working again (i do lighting for my school's productions) so i'm kind of gone. when i get home all i do is play minecraft on this new server i'm on, lol. i got a new gpu for xmas so i like to test it with shaders. unfortunately, playing minecraft with shaders is a nightmare even if it looks good.<br><br>i'm playing on the origins mod, and i'm an elytrian. some people are making profile webpages, so i might make one of my own soon! i will show it off when it's done :)<br><br>here's the only finished build i've done, the orb <br><br><img src="./assets/minecraftscreenshot.png" width="300px"><br><br>this is my home base and i'm working on smaller builds around it, such as a bridge, etc. but i'm also grinding for better tools and stuff. idk. i'm having fun!</p>

                i got an A on my ap mech exam! also like a C on my (calc ab) math exam. whatever. pure math is for losers. applied mathematics changes the WORLD!!!!<br> <br>
            also. i didn't study for math lol :)<br><br>i finally got all my university application results back. 4 acceptances, 3 deferrals, and 2 rejections. unfortunately i was rejected from my dream school of umich :(<br>i'm probably going to penn state for data science.<br><br><div align="center"><img src="./assets/80x15 buttons/PENN ST-LIONS.png" height="12px"></div><br>when thinking about university, i have to think about how i will run soupy with a new computer. because i had to wipe my current laptop, this will be the third iteration of software used to run soupy!<br><br>my current idea is to replace vscode with nvim. this is mostly because i can't find a vscode theme that matches my kitty theme identitically, and i'm too lazy to make one. however, i really like vscode. nvim is fine but honestly i don't need to be a tech bro who does everything in the terminal. it's 2023!<br><br>ok that's it for now, bye :3 <img src="./assets/notes.webp"></p>

            re my last entry: i managed to escape covid!! i'm pretty happy about it, because it causes my RA to flare up. also, my parents would probably not be happy with you know. getting it again. my dad has some pretty long-lasting effects from when i got covid in april 22, so we don't want to risk going through that shit again. but anyways, that's the best news of my week. no news.<br><br>i keep getting into universities and i keep trying to care, but i can't. :). does it really matter? not to me, not right now. i feel as though i don't exist, they're just pushing emails to a bot that wrote applications on its own. like i'm some sort of spam, junk mail, a scam that they've fallen for. i could be a good scam artist.<br><br>i started bojack horseman finally. i know, it's like, 'how have you never seen bojack horseman' but im just getting around to it now cuz idk i needed to be in the perfect mode and this is it. i quote it all the time so i may as well fuckin watch it lol. i know a lot of points (i was obsessed with sarah lynn briefly) from the plot but not how they connect so the story is still new to me despite the spoilers.<br><br>have a good weekend everybody! in the united states, it's a long weekend to celebrate mlk jr's birthday and i get to study for my ridiculously timed midterms. so excited (nawwwt).<br><br><img src="./assets/kitty.webp"></p>
