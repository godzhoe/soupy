<div class="entry"><p><strong>january 6th, 2022</strong><br>Two days ago, I slipped on the ice and fell, practically breaking my foot. Now, it is walkable, but still a pain in my ass. Funnily enough, the way I walk on an injured foot is very flat compared to my normal stride–so my knee is hurting too. I’m not having the greatest time.<br><br>In American Literature I am being forced against my will to read Edgar Allen Poe, but watching my literature teacher scramble to explain psychological theories is very funny. No one talks about how Freud wanted to fuck his mom–most big psychoanalysis professors aren’t really that right in the head. Anyway,<br><br>Ego death is something I’m very familiar with. In the first days of 2020, my previous ego had up and killed itself right in front of my eyes. The grieving process was close to that of a loved one, but, under the stress, I had rebuilt myself from genuine nothingness. This also coincided with the beginning of my femininity, where I would soon become extremely femme in contrast to my masculine presentation mere months before. But I wish he could see me now: mildly slutty, very much in pain, but with an ego that could combat god himself.<br><br>Friends have told me that it’s a histrionic personality disorder, to have self-awareness like this. I’ve never thought of it that way. Many people have given me an array of armchair diagnoses–schizoid, borderline, histrionic, autism, bipolar–but it doesn’t really matter, does it? And at the offense of the medical community and those who prioritize doctors’ notes over anything else on the internet; regardless of whatever goes on my medical record I won’t suddenly change, my problems won’t suddenly become legitimate, it only provides legality. <br><br>(Just yesterday I pushed my ACT accommodations request. That is an example of legality, and it requires a diagnosis. However, my personality does not.)<br><br>I’m hoping for it to snow again tonight. Not having school tomorrow would be great for my foot, giving it time to recover.</p></div>
<div class="entry"><p><Strong>january 5th, 2022</Strong><br>I am excited to say that I have launched my first website. While I've had a passion for HTML since 2018, I had never felt that it was complete until i published this page. Obviously, this website is still very vacant, but the publishication in of itself is something I am proud of.<br><br>I showed my github hosting to my mother, and she was impressed. So, I have decided to continue this project. Down below is a previous thing I have written as a way to fill this diary, you may read if you'd like.<br><br>Thank you for your visit here, really. I appreaciate it more than explainable, person on the internet.</p></div>
<div class="entry"><p><strong>october 25, 2021</strong><br>I’ve found that women’s fashion is ridiculously expensive, however, the dresses are so nice. I love being able to sit next to my femme friends and comparing dresses that barely cover our asses to wear to a school dance afterparty. I am running broke, constantly, because of my infatuation with clothes. I pour money into clothes, makeup, and other feminine products that a butch guy would not even think of wearing. I feel as though being femme is only available when you have money. When I’m at home, I wear a t-shirt and sweatpants with no makeup and my hair in a scrunchie. My breasts and ass are both small, so I could pass as masculine, however, I hate it. If I were to go outside, I would have to wear some makeup or change my outfit entirely (which I often do) to feel confident in the gaze of other people. Femme is a show that I put on, but without the show, I feel naked and unlike my true self. I fear that a lack of income will result in isolation as I am not able to show who I am to the world.</p>
