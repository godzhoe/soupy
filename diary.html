            re my last entry: i managed to escape covid!! i'm pretty happy about it, because it causes my RA to flare up. also, my parents would probably not be happy with you know. getting it again. my dad has some pretty long-lasting effects from when i got covid in april 22, so we don't want to risk going through that shit again. but anyways, that's the best news of my week. no news.<br><br>i keep getting into universities and i keep trying to care, but i can't. :). does it really matter? not to me, not right now. i feel as though i don't exist, they're just pushing emails to a bot that wrote applications on its own. like i'm some sort of spam, junk mail, a scam that they've fallen for. i could be a good scam artist.<br><br>i started bojack horseman finally. i know, it's like, 'how have you never seen bojack horseman' but im just getting around to it now cuz idk i needed to be in the perfect mode and this is it. i quote it all the time so i may as well fuckin watch it lol. i know a lot of points (i was obsessed with sarah lynn briefly) from the plot but not how they connect so the story is still new to me despite the spoilers.<br><br>have a good weekend everybody! in the united states, it's a long weekend to celebrate mlk jr's birthday and i get to study for my ridiculously timed midterms. so excited (nawwwt).<br><br><img src="./assets/kitty.webp"></p>
