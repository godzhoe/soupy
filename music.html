      <li><span class="caret">belladonna of sadness : alexandra savior</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          <li>if you like lana del rey or similar, alexandra savior is an amazing pick for you. her music is smooth and flows very well. also uses a lot of feminine and masculine terms to protray lovers, so bisexuality win!<br></li>
          <li><strong>favorite track:</strong> girlie</li>
           
          
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><span class="caret">hospice : the antlers</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          <li> i have never cried to an album like i have this one. cancer isn't very prominent in my family, but oh my god, the abuse is protrayed so well. if you're super into liberal feminism i might not recommend because of the misogyny laced in the album, but i think with a bit of tolerance the larger message is so important. before you come at me for this take, i'm a woman, and a lesbian at that.</li>
          <li><strong>favorite track:</strong> two</li>
           
        </ul>
      </li>  
      <li><span class="caret">wildflower : the avalanches</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          <li>the avalanches holds a dear place in my heart and i'm actually happy to see they're getting more mainstream attention. wildflower sounds like what i believe it's like to die, which i am obsessed with. loved this album since the day it came out. while i don't think it's for everyone, you should definitely try and listen at least once.<br></li>
          <li><strong>favorite track:</strong> harmony</li>
           
          
        </ul>
      </li>  
      <li><span class="caret">goths : the mountain goats</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          <li>my favorite tmg album. i'm not goth nor am i from the west coast but the vibe this album holds is so special to me. also one of the first tmg albums i listened to as a young teenager, i always had it on repeat until i got sick of hearing it. recently, i've revisted it to find my love for this album once again.<br></li>
          <li><strong>favorite track:</strong> paid in cocaine</li>
           
          
        </ul>
      </li> 
      <li><span class="caret">give up : the postal service</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          <li>one of the albums i still listen to from childhood. the music all has a similar message, but the music gets so stuck in your head you want to listen to it regardless. the covers in the 20th anniversary deluxe edition are amazing too.<br></li>
          <li><strong>favorite track:</strong> brand new colony</li>
           
          
        </ul>
      </li> 
      <li><span class="caret">the lo-fis : steve lacy</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          <li>steve lacy's shortest album but one of my favorites. the entire album can be listened to as one song, it flows together that well. my only complaint is that i wish the songs were longer, but if your attention span is small and you really love the choruses of steve lacy's more popular songs, such as dark red or helmet, you'll love these snippets.<br></li>
          <li><strong>favorite track:</strong> that's no fun</li>
           
          
        </ul>
      </li> 
      <li><span class="caret">bastard : tyler the creator</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          <li>i love tyler the creator, there's not much music of his i don't listen to. however, because i mostly listen on spotify, listening to bastard is always a refreshing experience. if you like older tyler's trending audios, such as tron cat, radicals, or yonkers, you'll like bastard. goblin is a more polished version of this album, i think, but i love the messiness of old tyler.<br></li>
          <li><strong>favorite track:</strong> inglorious</li>

        <ul class="nested">
          <li>honestly i have no idea what this guy is saying and all the translations on the internet are horrible. however, i love the sound of his music. the way he stresses his voice reaches beyond lanaguage barriers and the art and creates mixed feelings with amazing instrumentals and magnificent vocals. an amazing art punk album.  幽霊 (yurei) is its flagship song, as it got put on discover weekly on spotify one time or another, but the rest of the album is amazing as well.<br></li>
          <li><strong>favorite track:</strong>  幽霊 (yurei)</li>

      <li><span class="caret">renaissance : beyonce</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          <li>the first time i listened to this album i immediately fell in love with it. the only reason it's not in my all-time favorites is because i don't listen to much beyonce otherwise. an amazing pop album, she is a genius and deserves all the fame she gets. i adore her cover of <em>i feel love</em> in summer renaissance.<br></li>
          <li><strong>favorite track:</strong> summer renaissance</li>
           
          
        </ul>
      </li> 
      <li><span class="caret">sober to death : car seat headrest</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          <li>the only car seat headrest album i <em>really</em> listen to, but still very good. i do think the 2018 remaster is better than the original, sorry.<br></li>
          <li><strong>favorite track:</strong> beach life-in-death</li>
          
        </ul>
      </li>  
      <li><span class="caret">stratosphere : duster</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          <li>the classic duster album to me. this was also my first introduction to duster, so i have a bias towards it. very cohesive and an excellent introduction if you want to get into their music.<br></li>
          <li><strong>favorite track:</strong> heading for the door</li>
           
          
        </ul>
      </li>  
      <li><span class="caret">garbage (20th anniversary remaster) : garbage</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          <li>the specific iteration of this album is noted because the tracklist varies. garbage was a band created by several producers and a vocalist to give a grunge feel to a pop band. very awesome. does not wear with time<br></li>
          <li><strong>favorite track:</strong> as heaven is wide</li>
          
        </ul>
      </li>  
      <li><span class="caret">dirty computer : janelle monae</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          <li>the concept album that got me into concept albums. her sound is amazing and insanely catchy, it feels like you can dance to every song. also i'm biased, because i think janelle monae is hot. but i loved this album before i knew who she was.<br></li>
          <li><strong>favorite track:</strong> take a byte</li>
          
        </ul>
      </li>  
      <li><span class="caret">good kid, m.a.a.d city : kendrick lamar</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          <li>a very solid, classic kendrick album. if you want to get into his stuff, this is a good place to start. well, it's where i started.<br></li>
          <li><strong>favorite track:</strong> sing about me, i'm dying of thirst</li>
           
          
        </ul>
      </li>  
      <li><span class="caret">mr morale & the big steppers : kendrick lamar</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          <li>this is a newer album and when i first listened to it i'll be honest, i had mixed feelings. to me, this is one of those albums you have to listen multiple times to get into the groove of, but once you do, it's actually very good. the controversy surrounding it makes me laugh, too. maybe skip auntie diaries.<br></li>
          <li><strong>favorite track:</strong> mirror</li>
           
          
        </ul>
      </li>  
      <li><span class="caret">born to die : lana del rey</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          <li>this is in very close competition with ultraviolence. i adore classic lana with my full heart, even if i don't listen to her new stuff as much. i'm sure you know who lana is and have seen plenty of reviews for her. i don't have much more to add.<br></li>
          <li><strong>favorite track:</strong> million dollar man</li>

      <li><span class="caret">lsd and the search for god : lsd and the search for god</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          <li>a great "slowcore" or "ambience" album, i've slept to it many times and played it as background noise for homework. a great introduction to these genres, as its easily digestible and a relatively short ep.<br></li>
          <li><strong>favorite track:</strong> starting over</li>
           
          
        </ul>
      </li> 
      <li><span class="caret">fantasies : metric</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          <li>another childhood album, which has gained a little bit of popularlity lately. while i listen to a good chunk of their music, this album is my favorite. i think it flows the best and has an authentic touch that the later albums tend to lose grip on.<br></li>
          <li><strong>favorite track:</strong> front row</li>
           
          
        </ul>
      </li> 
      <li><span class="caret">tell it to the volcano : miniature tigers</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          <li>i love this album so much. it's pretty peppy despite the actual lyrics being sort of pathetic. i can listen to this album all the way through no matter what my mood is. <br></li>
          <li><strong>favorite track:</strong> annie oakley</li>
          
        </ul>
      </li>  
      <li><span class="caret">retired from sad, new career in business : mitski</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          <li>being a mitski girlie is an art form. honestly, i love a lot of mitski songs, but thematically this album is my favorite. there's a depressing tone in this album that makes me fall in love with it. so much trauma packed into one single album<br></li>
          <li><strong>favorite track:</strong> shame</li>
          
        </ul>
      </li>  
      <li><span class="caret">you're gonna miss it all : modern baseball</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          <li>a great album if you're into guys complaining that his girlfriend dumped him. also a good representation of unrequited crushes and slow burn love. i love these guys<br></li>
          <li><strong>favorite track:</strong> two good things</li>
           
          
        </ul>
      </li>  
      <li><span class="caret">chip chrome and the mono-tones : the neighbourhood</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          <li>their newest album! i don't like many covid albums, but this one eventually wormed its way into my head. experimental pop. my dad didn't like it very much when i played it in the car.<br></li>
          <li><strong>favorite track:</strong> silver lining</li>
          
        </ul>
      </li> 
      <li><span class="caret">hard to imagine the neighbourhood ever changing : the neighbourhood</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          <li>while not my favorite album from the neighbourhood, this is a great contender for an introduction to the band. this album blends their older and newer sound together to create a nice bridge in their discography, whichever direction you choose to go. older is more pop, while newer is more experimental.<br></li>
          <li><strong>favorite track:</strong> roll call</li>
          
        </ul>
      </li>  
      <li><span class="caret">married in mount airy : nicole dollanganger</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          <li>her new album! a flow that reminds me of older albums than ode to dawn weiner (below), but carries strong themes from her previous discography. if you like her already, this will be more of what you love.<br></li>
          <li><strong>favorite track:</strong> nymphs finding the head of orpheus</li>
          
        </ul>
      </li>  
      <li><span class="caret">ode to dawn weiner embarassing love songs : nicole dollanganger</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          <li>nicole dollanganger was definitely part of what made me crazy. if you like soft, smooth music with fucked up undertones, this is the album for you. it's also the easiest listen out of her discography imo<br></li>
          <li><strong>favorite track:</strong> blue moon motel</li>
          
        </ul>
      </li>   
      <li><span class="caret">dark side of the moon : pink floyd</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          <li>an album that deserves the praise and reputation it gets. well composed, well produced, basically a required listen if you want to have any respect in the progressive rock scene.<br></li>
          <li><strong>favorite track:</strong> us and them</li>
           
          
        </ul>
      </li> 
      <li><span class="caret">arkhaiomelisidonophunikheratos : satanicpornocultshop</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          <li>a super experimental album, but i love it. if you like music that makes you uncomfortable, this is the one for you. however, some songs have a very good rhythm to them that makes me come back again and again. a very odd album, but that doesn't mean it's bad. might not be for everybody<br></li>
          <li><strong>favorite track:</strong> left handed darling</li>
           
          
        </ul>
      </li>  
      
      <li><span class="caret">almost famous : slutever</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          <li>one of my favorite riot grrrl albums. really brings out the feminism. haha anyway if you're more of a punk fan this album is great for you. a short listen, honestly i'm sad because the band doesn't really have that many songs.<br></li>
          <li><strong>favorite track:</strong> i miss america</li>
           
          
        </ul>
      </li>  
      
      <li><span class="caret">drugs and guns for everyone : that handsome devil</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          <li>if you know the genres of my other album recommendations, this one feels completely out of left field. i don't know why, but i am so obsessed with how this album sounds. the hysterical feeling that comes with his voice is magnificent and protrays stress very well. music to make you feel like you're going insane.<br></li>
          <li><strong>favorite track:</strong> time machine</li>
           
          
        </ul>
      </li>  
      <li><span class="caret">igor : tyler the creator</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          <li>very good album to start if you like newer hip-hop music with heavier attention on the instrumentals and mixing. tyler's lyrics are signifigantly less aggressive than in his older albums, but still hold the same type of energy. also, there's tons of stuff on igor that there isn't for older albums, if you're a fandom type of person.<br></li>
          <li><strong>favorite track:</strong> puppet</li>

      <li><span class="caret">who really cares : tv girl</span>
        <ul class="nested">
          <li>tv girl is very popular these days, but i liked them before they got big. not to flex, or whatever. who really cares is not actually my favorite album from them, but i think it's a good starting album if you want to get into tv girl. has some super popular tracks on here, so you'll recognize them.</li>
          <li><strong>favorite track:</strong> song about me</li>

        <ul class="nested">
          <li>original incelcore. without him, we would not have the culture of pathetic men we have today. i love his whining. you should listen to it too<br></li>
