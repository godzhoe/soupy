            <td id="1" class="post">soup is a LITTLE FREAK with love in her heart but also not really. she's an elytrian but is shitballs at flying but it means that most of her builds are in the air. when she joined she created a home in shape of THE ORB in order for her to feel some sort of familiarity.<br><br>
                <span class="pink">appearance</span><br><br>black hair in a bob-cut with twin braids down the front. white oxford shirt with red tie & a black crewneck cardigan. ripped jeans or brown slacks. ram horns (for no particular reason). elytra wings are similar to the mizuno's texture pack's elytra <a href="./assets/elytra.png" target="_blank">example here</a><br><br>young-adult aged. "short" stature but not an outlier. shorter than iggy, so
                <br><br><span class="pink">origin</span><br><br>soup is an elytrian therefore she has these benefits/disadvantages:<br><br>+ permanent elytra<br>+ 20 block boost every 30s<br>+ 2x damage in the air<br>- weak&slow under buildings<br>- light armor
                <br><br><span class="pink">the orb</span><br><br>soup's primary "lore" revolves around the orb. see page labelled accordingly
                <br><br><span class="pink">silly disclaimer</span><br><br>i'm not really inclined on telling a serious or in-depth story. soup is just an overexaggerated persona and a silly character. her story comes from the "pondering the orb" meme. if anything reads as offensive/etc. hit me up i will remove it. be nice & have fun :)</td>

LOL silly you can't do that! but maybe you can follow THE ORB. you know? like, it's something everyone does these days. it's so hip. it will make you cool. it'll make your parents love you again. THE ORB can fix anything! THE ORB gives advice that guidance counselors cower in fear of. THE ORB knows whats best for you. <br><br>the orb is not a living thing, and therefore cannot be killed. the orb is a stone. the orb is the atmosphere. the orb is you and me. but the orb cannot die.<br><br>would you like to hear more about the orb? contact SOUP @ SOUPONLINE for possible information. let God dictate whether its stone accepts you. we are all under THE ORBs will.<br><br><span class="pink">in order for the orb to love you</span><br><br>you must give yourself to the orb<br>the orb will let you fly<br>the orb will save you<br>the orb will clog your ears<br>the orb will make you slow<br>the orb will make enemies stronger<br>the orb will help you fight<br>the orb needs you to rely on him<br>the orb is god<br>weaken yourself to god<br><br>check out this orb<br><br>--<br>|  |<br>--<br><br>pretty cool right</td>
