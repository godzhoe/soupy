<div class="entry"><p><strong>february 7th, 2022</strong><br>honestly i have nothing to tell you nor my therapist. i have therapy every week, yet, i have no idea what i’m going to talk about. my life has been pretty boring.<br><br>general thoughts go like this:<br><br>in my period, i wonder why religion calls for woman to repurify after a monthly cycle. is having female anatomy not meant to be pure in its birth? i believe god is worth all that is good in the world but i question his meanings in this culture build against periods. women bleed, women hurt, women sacrifice to continue a good life and survival yet, are punished nonetheless? <br><br>and women are not even intended to have sex until marriage, so periods are endless. there is no true cleanse of sin. women are doomed to be impure under the most orthodox of religious rule.<br><br>i’m very interested in the internet again lately. with a big controversy spiking the hits in kiwifarms, it makes me wonder once again the foundation of propaganda for the sake of laughter. the true answer is not to care. <br><br>i used after effects the other day! i’m revisiting my old creative habits. it makes me smile. hopefully, in time, i will have enough energy to continue finishing up this website as well. only in due time, for now, i want to keep up these diary entries as a reminder of this sites’ existence. i won’t let it die.<br><br>this month is not better. this month is not worse. everything is simply a constant.</p></div>
